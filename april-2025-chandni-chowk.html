                <p>While enjoying some much-needed time off in my hometown Pune, hopping from one restaurant to another, an old memory resurfaced — a long-standing wish to visit Old Delhi and taste its legendary food. I’d heard about it since my school days, and suddenly realized this was the perfect chance to finally make it happen.</p>
                <p>I planned a quick one-day trip: caught a flight from PNQ at 9:40 AM, landed in Delhi (DEL) by 11:55 AM, and booked a return for the same night at 10 PM. (Pro tip: If you have DigiYatra enabled, your airport experience becomes a hundred times smoother and faster!) After landing, I hopped onto the Airport Express Metro straight from Terminal 3 to Chandni Chowk — just ₹65 and super convenient.</p>

                <h2>Arrival in Chandni Chowk</h2>
                <p>As soon as you step into Chandni Chowk, you’re hit by an ocean of people, colors, sounds, and smells all at once. In front of me stood the beautiful Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib, while the tip of the iconic Red Fort peeked out to my left. To my right? An endless street so packed you could barely see a few feet ahead.</p>
                <p>I let my instincts lead me — following the smell of chimney smoke and the mouthwatering aromas drifting through the street — straight toward lunch.</p>

                <h2>Paranthe Wali Gali</h2>
                <p>Soon, I found myself at the famous Paranthe Wali Gali, a narrow lane crammed with historic paratha shops, some dating back to the 1910s. There used to be six paratha shops here; only Shops 4, 5, and 6 were open that day. I chose Shop 6 and ordered an Okra and Chilli Paratha — deep-fried to crispy perfection and served with three kinds of chutneys, including one made with chopped banana.</p>
                <p>The taste was absolutely incredible — heavy, yes, but unlike any paratha I’d ever eaten before.</p>

                <h2>Old Delhi Jalebi Wala</h2>
                <p>Next up was a stop at the famous Old Delhi Jalebi Wala. Here, I had hot jalebis paired with a generous serving of rabdi — a flavor so rich and smooth, it just melted in my mouth. Absolutely divine!</p>

                <h2>Red Fort (Lal Qila)</h2>
                <p>With my belly half-full and my curiosity growing, I walked toward the majestic Red Fort. Built by the Mughals in the 17th century, it’s a sprawling complex with stunning architecture. An hour is enough to stroll through the premises and snap some great pictures — just be prepared for thick crowds!</p>

                <h2>The Food Tour (Round 2)</h2>
                <p>After all that walking, it was time for Round 2 of my food adventures.</p>
                <p>First stop: Natraj Dahi Bhalle Corner, a historic little shop from the 1940s. Their chaat is a must-try — tangy, refreshing, and purely vegetarian.</p>
                <p>As evening set in, my carnivore instincts kicked in hard. Around 7 PM, it was time to hunt for some serious non-veg food. Enter Karim’s — the legendary restaurant often featured in food documentaries and considered the crown jewel of Old Delhi cuisine.</p>
                <p>I kicked things off with a plate of Chicken Seekh Kebabs — tender, flavorful, and buttery soft. Then came the legendary Mutton Korma — a rich, soul-satisfying dish that completely lived up to the hype. Truly a carnivore’s paradise!</p>
                <p>Still hungry for more, I hopped over to a nearby spot called Zahra, where I devoured some excellent Chicken Kebabs and a plate of Chicken Dum Biryani that was simply heavenly.</p>

                <h2>Wrapping up with Sweets</h2>
                <p>No meal is truly complete without dessert. I walked to the Amritsari Lassi Wala at the far end of Chandni Chowk to cool down with a glass of lassi. They offer some unique flavors like Mango, Banana, and Rose.</p>
                <p>And of course, the grand finale — a visit to the iconic Kuremal Mahavir Prasad Kulfiwale, famous for their innovative takes on traditional Indian ice creams. Totally different, totally worth it.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Traveler's Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pickpockets are common. Always keep your bag latched and valuables in your front pockets.</li>
                    <li><strong>History Corner:</strong> Chandni Chowk was developed by Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century and served as one of the biggest trade hubs of the time. It was also where the emperor showcased his victories by parading the defeated kings' bodies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Although Old Delhi is where the world-famous Butter Chicken was born, the family that invented it couldn't carry the legacy forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hidden Gems:</strong> A little further into Paratha Wali Gali, you'll find nine houses built for the Jain community in the 17th century. These families managed the emperor's finances back then. There's also a beautiful Jain temple tucked away there.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>On a personal note, walking these ancient streets, I couldn’t help but think — while our forefathers were fighting for freedom, the folks here were busy perfecting recipes that have stood the test of time. A day at Chandni Chowk isn’t just about the food; it’s a trip through layers of living history, culture, and flavor.</p>
                <p>If you’re even remotely considering it — just go. One day is enough for memories that’ll last a lifetime.</p>
